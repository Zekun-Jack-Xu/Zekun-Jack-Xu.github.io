Welcome to Zekun Xu's Github page. I am currently a phd student in [_Statistics at North Carolina State University_](http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/). I worked for two years as biostatistician before entering the current phd program. During the program, I had research internship experience at SAS Institute and data scientist internship experience at Google. My research interests are hidden Markov models, reinforcement learning, time series analysis and causal inference.
