#### Latent state space models for longitudinal accelerometer data

- Developed gradient-based estimation and inference for a subject-specific hidden semi-Markov model
for longitudinal zero-inflated cat accelerometer data. 

- Presented at the [2017 Pain in Animals Workshop](https://paw2017.com/schedule) at the NIH Natcher
conference center in Bethesda, MD.

- Developed a parallel, distributed optimization for the continuous-time hidden Markov model to
characterize human physical activity from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

#### Evaluating the signal quality of wearable devices

- Used penalized logistic regression, SVM, neural network, random forest and gradient boosted tree to classify physical activities.

- Compared the heart rate signal quality across activities using weighted generalized estimating
equations method.

#### Regularized autoregressive hidden semi-Markov model for financial returns

- Used a flexible pth order vector autoregressive hidden semi-Markov to
analyze multivariate financial time series.

- Augmented the EM algorithm with regularization to stabilize the parameter
estimation.

#### Data mining with the Truven Health Insurance Claim Database
- Used a greedy propensity-score matched logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with
fracture nonunion in the highly unbalanced population of surgical and nonsurgical patients.

- Implemented different imputation methods for missing data.


#### Time-varying trend in ozone time series 

- Built a linear state space model for the prediction and inference on the ozone
time series.

- Implemented stochastic approximation EM algorithm with
Kalman filter for parameter estimation.
