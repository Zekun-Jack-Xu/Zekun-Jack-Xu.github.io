#### Partially Observable Markov Decision Process for Personalized Medicine
 
 - Propose a partially observable Markov decision process framework that recommends personalized
treatment for maximizing patient outcome.

- Study asymptotics and causal inference in Q-Learning and V-learning with
functional approximation.

#### Hidden Markov Models for Longitudinal Accelerometer Data
 
- Develop a gradient-based estimation and inference for hierarchical hidden Markov model on zero-inflated count data.  

- Apply the methodology on clinical accelerometer data for arthritic cat and human physical activity.

#### Two Sigma:  Using News to Predict Stock Movement

-  Leverage news and market information to predict stock movement using neural network, random
 forest and gradient boosting tree. (Top 7% on Kaggle)
 
#### Data mining with the Truven Health Insurance Claim Database

-  Build a propensity-score matched logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with fracture
 nonunion in the highly unbalanced population of surgical and nonsurgical patients.

-  Implement multiple imputation methods for missing data.
